# Python program for implementation of Quicksort

# This function is same in both iterative and recursive
def partition(arr, l, h):
  #write your code here
  pass


def quickSortIterative(arr, l, h):
  #write your code here
  pass

    ##NOTE: I will be submitting both the quick sort problems once the concept have been taught in class. 
    ##I have always struggled understanding how quick sort worked, once the concept is taught, 
    ## and I am able to understand how it works, I will attempt both Q2 and Q5 of quick sort.
