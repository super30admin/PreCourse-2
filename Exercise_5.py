# Python program for implementation of Quicksort

# Time Complexity : O(N log N) --> best and average case; O(n^2) --> worst case
# Space Complexity :O(log N) --> best and average case; O(n) --> worst case
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode? : Verified by succesfully running on code editor
# Any problem you faced while coding this : No

# This function is same in both iterative and recursive
