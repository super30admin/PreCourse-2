# All Instructions are already provided in the respective files.

Exercise_1 : Binary Search.
<br>Time complexity:O(logn)
<br>Space complexity:O(1)
<br> Approach:find midpoint and move left and right based on the compariosn of value with mid.

Exercise_2 : Quick sort.
<br>Time complexity:O(nlogn)
<br>Space complexity:O(1)
<br> Approach:select pivot as first element, create partition and then do the comparison and swap


Exercise_3 : Find Mid Point of a Singly Linked List.
<br>Time complexity:O(n)
<br>Space complexity:O(1)
<br> Approach:use fast(2 steps) and slow pointer(1 step), fast will be at end when slow will be at mid.


Exercise_4 : Merge Sort.
<br>Time complexity:O(nlogn)
<br>Space complexity:O(n)
<br> Approach: divide the array into halves recursively and then sort them.


Exercise_5 : Iterative Quick Sort.
<br>Time complexity:O(nlogn)
<br>Space complexity:O(1)
<br> Approach:We use a stack for storing sub-array start and end index but with same partitioning logic.
