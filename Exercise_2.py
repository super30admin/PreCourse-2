# Python program for implementation of Quicksort Sort

    ##NOTE: I will be submitting both the quick sort problems once the concept have been taught in class. 
    ##I have always struggled understanding how quick sort worked, once the concept is taught, 
    ## and I am able to understand how it works, I will attempt both Q2 and Q5 of quick sort.
