# Function to do Quick sort 
# Quick Sort uses the concept of a pivot. Say the first element is the pivot. In every iteration, all the elements less than the pivot are moved towards its left and the elements greater than the pivot are moved towards its right. Two pointers i and j are used. In every iteration, i is incremented until an element greater than the pivot is found, j is decremented until an element less than the pivot is found. Element at i and j are swapped. In the element, pivot is swapped with the element at the jth index.
def quickSort(arr,low,high):
    
    #write your code here
    if low < high: #If it is a valid array
        j = partition(arr, low, high) #Partition the array by using a pivot. All the elements towards its left should be less than the pivot and all the elements towards its right should be greater than the pivot. The array will be partitioned into two separate portions to conquer.
        quickSort(arr, low, j) #Run quick sort on the left side of the array
        quickSort(arr, j+1, high) #Run quick sort on the right side of the array
  
# Driver code to test above
