# Exercise_3 : Find Mid Point of a Singly Linked List

# Time Complexity: O(N), N = number of elements in array
# Space Complexity: O(N) to create the linked list, O(1) to find the middle node
# Successful Run on Leetcode: Yes (https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)
# Challenges: None
